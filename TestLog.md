These are tests in which I look for bugs or errors.

Test 1.  Listings Purchased: 2 (+$0.46)
- 100 Queries
- 4 Viable Listings
- 3 Instances of Non-Filtration
- 1 XMLHttpRequest Error

Test 2.  Listings Purchased: 1 (+$0.05)
- 100 Queries
- 0 Viable Listings
- 5 Instances of Non-Filtration
- 5 Instances of slow server response
- Erros may be caused by a server-side issue at the time (outlier?)
